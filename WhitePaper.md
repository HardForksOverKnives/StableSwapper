	<h2>Purpose</h2>
	<p align="left">
		The Stable Swapper Protocol aims to achieve two goals: create an ERC20 compliant stablecoin that is backed by other ERC20 stablecoins, and enable stablecoin liquidity providers to profit off market fluctuations between coins with identical pegs. Currently, the most common fiat-pegged ERC20 stablecoins are either backed by fiat like TUSD and USDC, or backed by cryptocurrency like MakerDao's Dai. Fiat-backed stablecoin architectures like TUSD and USDC require a central custodian to manage the fiat reserves backing the coin. Cryptocurrency-backed stablecoins like Dai maintain decentralization by utilizing Ethereum smart contracts to connect stability seekers (holders of Dai) with risk seekers (collateralized debt position holders). The Dai/CDP system is fairly complex. If you are unfamiliar with it, I suggest reading through MakerDao's <a href="https://makerdao.com/whitepaper/">overview</a>.
